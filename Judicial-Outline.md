Okay, this is a profound way to structure biblical legal and judicial content. Applying the 5-point covenant model (THEOS) as a fractal pattern allows for a deep, layered analysis.

Here's the reorganization of the previously identified verses (both the general list and the specific Jesus/OT law links) into this framework. The category names draw from legal/judicial scholarship, with the THEOS point indicated in parentheses.

**Methodology Notes:**

1.  **Verse Placement:** Verses are placed in the category that best reflects their *primary* judicial/legal theme according to the THEOS model. Many verses could arguably fit in multiple categories; the placement reflects a judgment call on the dominant aspect.
2.  **Fractal Application:** The second level (A-E within I-V) applies the THEOS model *within* the context of the main category. This reveals finer nuances.
3.  **Inclusivity:** This includes both the broad list of judicial verses and the specific examples of Jesus interacting with OT law.
4.  **Representativeness:** This structure organizes the *examples* previously generated. A truly comprehensive, verse-by-verse analysis of the entire Bible would expand this list immensely but likely fit within this structure.
5.  **Jesus' Sayings:** Where a saying of Jesus from the previous table fits, it's included. Note that his teachings often span multiple categories (e.g., reinterpreting a Law [E] based on God's ultimate authority [T] leading to a different judgment [O]).
