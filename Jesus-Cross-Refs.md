Okay, this is a fascinating but complex task. Jesus often taught by appealing to the *principles* and core commands (like the Decalogue or the Shema/Love Command) underlying the Law, or by intensifying its demands towards inner motive, rather than always citing specific case laws from Exodus 21-23, Leviticus, Numbers, or Deuteronomy. He also frequently debated interpretations of the Law (like Sabbath observance or purity rules) prevalent in his day.

Therefore, finding direct one-to-one matches for *every* saying to a *specific case law* is challenging. Many of his teachings relate more broadly to the Ten Commandments (Ex 20 / Deut 5), the command to love God (Deut 6:5) and neighbor (Lev 19:18), or prophetic calls for justice (Micah 6:8).

However, I will attempt to create a table linking some of Jesus' key teachings to the most relevant OT laws or legal principles within the specified corpora (Ex 20-23, Lev, Num, Deut), focusing on instances where a connection to a specific legal theme or regulation seems plausible. This will inevitably involve some interpretation regarding the underlying legal principle being addressed.

**Note:** This list is representative, not exhaustive, and focuses on clearer connections to legal/judicial themes found in the specified OT sections.

| **Matthew 5:21-22**      | Anger/insults are akin to murder, liable to judgment.      | Internalization/Intensification of Murder Prohibition              | **Exodus 20:13; Deut 5:17** (cf. Ex 21:12-14; Lev 24:17, 21; Num 35:16-34; Deut 19:4-13) | "You shall not murder." (Case laws detail penalties/cities of refuge for manslaughter vs murder) | Jesus connects the external act prohibited by law (murder) to the internal disposition (anger), extending the Law's scope.          |
| **Matthew 5:27-28**      | Looking with lustful intent is akin to adultery.           | Internalization/Intensification of Adultery Prohibition            | **Exodus 20:14; Deut 5:18** (cf. Lev 18:20; 20:10; Deut 22:22-24) | "You shall not commit adultery." (Case laws specify penalties for various adulterous acts)      | Jesus connects the external act (adultery) to the internal intent (lust), extending the Law's scope.                          |
| **Matthew 5:31-32**      | Divorce (except for sexual immorality) causes adultery.    | Reinterpreting/Restricting Grounds for Divorce                     | **Deuteronomy 24:1-4**                                     | Regulates divorce initiated by husband if he finds "indecency"; requires certificate.        | Jesus directly addresses the existing law/practice based on Deut 24, significantly narrowing the permissible grounds.      |
| **Matthew 5:33-37**      | Do not swear oaths at all; let 'Yes' be 'Yes'.           | Prohibition/Reinterpretation of Oaths                              | **Leviticus 19:12; Numbers 30:2; Deuteronomy 23:21-23**    | Do not swear falsely by God's name; fulfill vows made to the Lord.                           | Jesus addresses the practice of making oaths (regulated in OT law), advocating for simple truthfulness rendering oaths unnecessary. |
| **Matthew 5:38-42**      | Do not resist evil; turn the other cheek; go extra mile.   | Rejection of Personal Retaliation (Lex Talionis)                   | **Exodus 21:24-25; Leviticus 24:19-20; Deuteronomy 19:21** | "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth..." (Principle of proportionate justice, likely for courts)     | Jesus directly quotes the *lex talionis* principle and commands a response of non-retaliation instead of personal vengeance. |
| **Matthew 12:1-8** / Mark 2:23-28 / Luke 6:1-5 | Disciples pluck grain on Sabbath; Jesus defends action. | Interpretation/Application of Sabbath Law (Necessity/Mercy)        | **Exodus 20:8-11; Deut 5:12-15** (cf. Ex 31:14-17; 35:2-3; Num 15:32-36) | Command to keep Sabbath holy, refrain from work. (Cases involve penalty for violation)        | Jesus debates the *application* of Sabbath law, arguing necessity/mercy (like David) overrides ritual observance in this case. |
| **Matthew 12:9-14** / Mark 3:1-6 / Luke 6:6-11 | Healing a man's withered hand on the Sabbath.            | Interpretation/Application of Sabbath Law (Doing Good)             | **Exodus 20:8-11; Deut 5:12-15** (cf. Ex 23:12 - rest for animals) | Command to keep Sabbath holy, refrain from work.                                              | Jesus challenges restrictive interpretations, arguing doing good/saving life is lawful and aligns with the Sabbath's purpose.  |
| **Matthew 15:3-9** / Mark 7:6-13 | Corban rule used to neglect honoring parents.          | Tradition vs. Divine Commandment (Honoring Parents)                | **Exodus 20:12; Deut 5:16** (cf. Ex 21:17; Lev 20:9 - penalty for cursing parents) | "Honor your father and mother."                                                               | Jesus condemns using a tradition (Corban - dedicating funds to God) to nullify the direct commandment to care for parents.    |
| **Matthew 19:18-19** / Mark 10:19 / Luke 18:20 | Jesus lists commandments for eternal life.               | Summary of Core Moral Law relevant to Just Living                 | **Exodus 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20** (& **Lev 19:18**)          | Quotes several commands from the Decalogue (murder, adultery, theft, false witness, honor parents) & Lev 19:18. | Jesus points to observance of core commandments (foundational to the legal codes) as essential for righteous living.      |
| **Matthew 22:36-40** / Mark 12:28-34 | Greatest commandments: Love God, Love Neighbor.          | Summarizing the Entire Law's Foundation                          | **Deuteronomy 6:5** and **Leviticus 19:18**                | "You shall love the LORD your God..." and "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."          | Jesus identifies these two commands (from within the legal corpus) as the principles upon which all the Law and Prophets hang. |
| **Luke 10:25-37** (Good Samaritan) | Lawyer asks "Who is my neighbor?" re: Lev 19:18.      | Defining the Scope of "Neighbor" in Law                          | **Leviticus 19:18** (cf. Lev 19:33-34 - love stranger)    | "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."                                                   | The parable directly interprets and defines the *application* of the specific command from Leviticus.                         |
| **Matthew 23:23** / Luke 11:42 | Woe for tithing mint/dill but neglecting justice/mercy. | Prioritizing Weightier Matters of the Law                      | **Deuteronomy 14:22-23** (Tithing); **Deut 16:20; Lev 19:15** (Justice); **Ex 22:21-27** (Mercy/Care for vulnerable) | Laws require tithing; other laws mandate justice and care for poor/oppressed.                | Jesus critiques focus on minor regulations (like tithing herbs, cf. Deut 14:22) while ignoring core justice/mercy mandates (found throughout Deut, Lev, Ex). |
| **John 8:1-11** (NRSVue note: not in earliest MSS) | Woman caught in adultery; Jesus challenges accusers. | Application of Law/Justice tempered with Mercy                     | **Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22-24** (cf. Deut 17:6-7; 19:15 - witness requirement) | Adultery punishable by death; requires testimony of witnesses who cast first stone.          | Jesus interacts with the prescribed penalty, highlighting the requirement for witnesses and implicitly the need for judges without sin. |

This table highlights some key instances where Jesus' teachings directly engage with, interpret, intensify, or sometimes challenge the application of laws and principles found within the OT legal codes specified. It demonstrates his authority over the Law, often emphasizing its underlying intent related to love, justice, mercy, and inward righteousness over mere external compliance or loophole-finding.
